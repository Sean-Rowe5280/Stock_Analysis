# Stock Analysis: Understanding VBA Code and the Purpose of Refractoring
## Overview
### Purpose
Refractoring is the process of editing the logic of a code to increase how efficiently it runs and/or how easy it is to read and understand. It has a number of benefits and some drawbacks which I'll elaborate on later. In this project we were given the task of refractoring the a VBA code called "AllStocksAnalysis" which looked at stock trading data for the years 2017 and 2018 and produced a summary of some metrics for each stock to allow us to more easily evaluate investments. Our goal was to edit this original code to improve its effiecieny and ultimately the run time, this new refractored code is called "AllStocksAnalysisRefractored".
### Background
The data provided as previously mentioned was stock trading/pricing information for the years 2017 and 2018 which contained tickers(12 stocks the same for both years), the date, opening price, closing price, high and low price, adjusted closing price and the daily trade volume. The goal of writing a VBA code to perform the analysis of this data was to retrieve the total daily volume and the return for each stock in a given year and output that into an easily read summary.
